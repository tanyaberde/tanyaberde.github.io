* The goal of this page is to train a person's rhythm using a metronome. The user clicks a button
* to play a random regular beat (in beats per minute or bpm), after which they must model or follow
* without guidance from the computer. They do this for a set time.
* The computer then gives the user feedback about how they did (too slow, too fast, just right).
* User profits or starts over!
