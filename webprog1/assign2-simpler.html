// My original plan was to overlay a canvas over the brain image, prompt the user to enclose the outline of the brain region
// being asked for, push these canvas rectangle coordinates to an empty array, then give accuracy feedback to the user depending on
// whether their canvas includes any 1 member of the pre-determined poly coordinates from the polygon image maps I gave in Assignment 1.
// But yeesh THAT WAS TOO AMBITIOUS. My canvas was drawing and resizing fine, but I had difficulty placing the brain image
// within the bounds of the canvas, or treating it as a background image. I've saved that scrap code for another time.

// So here I start from scratch and make things simpler. Instead of poly coords, I give rect coords.
// Instead of 13 different pre-mapped regions, I start with 4.
// I prompt user to click where they think a given region is.
// If their mouseclick coord (x,y) is within my rect bounds for that region, they are correct. Otherwise, they are wrong.

var c = []; // Declare empty array to collect x and y coordinates of user's click. Don't need this, really.
var pons = new area("pons", "hindbrain", "metencephalon", "oldest", "sleep and arousal");
var thalamus = new area ("thalamus", "forebrain", "diencephalon", "newest", "sensory relay to cortex");
var cerebellum = new area("cerebellum", "hindbrain", "metencephalon", "oldest", "smooth motor action, coordinated movement, and conditioned learning");
var amygdala = new area("amygdala", "forebain", "telencephalon", "newest", "emotion, especially anxiety and fear");

// Get the coords of the current mouse click to the c array
function getMouseCoords() {
    var x = event.clientX;
    var y = event.clientY;
    c = String(x) + "," + String(y);
    console.log("My current mouseclick coords are "+ c);
    document.getElementById("coordinates").innerHTML = "My x and y coordinates are: "+ c;

It is among the phylogenetically " + this.phylo + " structures in the brain, as it is part of the " + this.primaryVesicle + ". " + "It is mainly involved in " + this.fxn + ". What structure of the brain is this?"
        areaCoords = document.getElementById("area").coords; // I'm lost! I want 'area' here to change depending on which test item button I click (pons, cerebellum, thalamus, or amygdala)
